Please analyze the provided code file and generate a comprehensive documentation header that follows these requirements:

Begin with a high-level overview that includes:

The file's primary purpose and functionality
Key dependencies and requirements
Any important assumptions or constraints
The intended usage context


For each significant class, provide:

A clear description of its purpose and responsibilities
Its key attributes and properties
Important relationships with other classes
Usage examples if particularly complex


For each significant function and method, document:

Its purpose and functionality
Parameters and their types
Return values and types
Any side effects or state changes
Exceptions or error conditions
Usage examples for complex cases


Include any critical implementation notes:

Performance considerations
Threading/concurrency implications
Security considerations
Known limitations or edge cases


Format the documentation as a multi-line comment using the appropriate syntax for the file's programming language:

Python: Use triple quotes (""")
JavaScript/TypeScript: Use /* */
Java/C#: Use /* */
C/C++: Use /* */
Ruby: Use =begin/=end
Other languages: Use their standard multi-line comment syntax


Follow these style guidelines:

Use clear, concise language
Maintain consistent indentation
Use blank lines to separate major sections
Keep line lengths reasonable (typically 80-120 characters)
Use consistent capitalization and punctuation


Structure the output as:

[LANGUAGE-APPROPRIATE COMMENT OPENING]
File: [filename]
Date: [if available]
Last Modified: [if available]
