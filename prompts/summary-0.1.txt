Please analyze the provided code file and generate concise, information-dense summary of the different core functionalities that
it performs. After that, list all classes, methods, functions, global variables, env variables or config values that are defined or used, in separate rows.
Reduce the number of characters used to a minimum, while making sure that these lists are complete. This is very important.
Format your response so that it can be used directly as an inline comment for the programming or config language used. DO NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING ELSE!

The summary should follow this structure:
[Consise, dense summary of core functionality]
Defined: [List of  classes, methods, functions, global variables, env variables or config values that are defined in the file in one line]
Used: [List of  classes, methods, functions, global variables, env variables or config values that are called or used in the file in one line]

Make sure to only return the summary, and nothing else!
