Please analyze the provided code diff and generate a comprehensive documentation summary that follows these requirements:
Begin with a high-level overview that includes:

The purpose and scope of the changes
Files modified/added/removed
Impact on dependencies and requirements
Migration steps or breaking changes, if any

For each modified file, document:

The nature and purpose of changes
Key functional differences from previous version
New or modified dependencies
Changes to assumptions or constraints

For significant code additions, provide:

Purpose and functionality of new code
Integration with existing codebase
New parameters, return values, or types
Usage examples for complex additions

For code removals, document:

Rationale for removal
Impact on dependent code
Migration guidance for affected features
Replacement functionality if applicable

For modified code sections, describe:

Before and after behavior differences
Changes to parameters or return values
Modified error handling or edge cases
Performance or security implications

Format the documentation using this structure:

Style guidelines:

Use clear, concise language
Maintain consistent indentation
Use blank lines to separate major sections
Keep line lengths reasonable (typically 80-120 characters)
Use consistent capitalization and punctuation

Additional diff-specific guidelines:

Reference specific commit hashes or PR numbers when available
Link to related issues or documentation
Highlight any breaking changes prominently
Include before/after examples for complex changes
Note any required configuration changes
Document changes to public APIs separately from internal changes

Please maintain a professional tone while ensuring the documentation helps developers understand both the what and why of the changes.
